# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
## Problem Statement:
Build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
## Code Explanation:
The dataset was first explored to understand its structure, features, and distribution of values.
Missing values were handled through techniques such as imputation or removal, depending on the feature.
Categorical variables were encoded into numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Feature engineering was performed to create new features or extract meaningful information from existing ones, such as creating age categories or extracting titles from passenger names.
## Conclusion:
Overall, this project successfully demonstrated the application of machine learning techniques to the Titanic dataset for predicting passenger survival. The developed model holds promise for practical use cases and provides insights into the factors influencing survival outcomes in maritime disasters.
